\arguments{
\item{fleets}{An object of class \code{FLFleet}, \code{FLFleets},
\code{FLFleetExt} or a \code{FLFleetsExt}.}

\item{method}{(Character) The algorithm used to fit the statistical model and
generate stochastic forecasts. Using the default is highly
recommended.}

\item{datayear}{(Integer) The final data year in the fleets object}

\item{TACyear}{(Integer) The projection year in the fleets object}

\item{nyrs}{(Integer) The number of historic years used to estimate
future catchability. Defaults to 3. Recommend > 10 if
using a random walk model.}

\item{deterministic}{(Logical) Should the results for first iteration be
a deterministic average of the historical period? Defaults
to \code{TRUE}}

\item{detMethod}{(Character) The method to calculate the deterministic average.
If "mean" then a simple mean of the most recent three data years
is used. Otherwise, the median of the stochastic forecast is
used.}

\item{verbose}{(Logical) Should the function print progress? Defaults
to \code{TRUE}}

\item{makeLog}{(Logical) Should the function generate a log of the methods
applied to each stock (and their success)? Defaults
to \code{TRUE}}

\item{makePlots}{(Logical) Should the function generate plots showing model
fit to data for each stock? Defaults to \code{TRUE}}

\description{
Function takes a \code{FLFleet}, \code{FLFleets}, \code{FLFleetExt} or a
\code{FLFleetsExt} object and fits a statistical model to historic
observations of metier-stock catchability for each fleet. The catchability
for future years is a stochastic forecast from fitted model parameters.
